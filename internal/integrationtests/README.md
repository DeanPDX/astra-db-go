# Integration Tests
To get started with these integration tests, create an instance on [astra.datastax.com](https://astra.datastax.com/). Then create an Application Token with appropriate permissions. Next, set the following environment variables:

- `API_ENDPOINT` - the endpoint for the instance you created.
- `APPLICATION_TOKEN` - the token you just created.

You can also use a `.env` file. Use [.env.example](./.env.example) as a template. Note the `TEST_PREFIX` property in there and what it does. For this reason, prefix test names with their domain/area:

```go
// Bad. There's no prefix we can use to run all collection-related integration tests.
func CreateCollection(e *harness.TestEnv) error { }
// Good. Setting TEST_PREFIX to "Collection" will match this test.
func CollectionCreate(e *harness.TestEnv) error { }
```

To run the tests:

```bash
# Will run these against your instance and print logs to stdout as well as
# a log file in ./logs.
go run github.com/datastax/astra-db-go/internal/integrationtests
```

Note that the files in [./tests](./tests) end with `_tests.go`, not `_test.go` because they aren't actually unit tests and we don't want them excluded from the `integrationtests` executable.
